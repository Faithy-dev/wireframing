# Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a simple, visual blueprint or schematic of a website or appâ€™s layout. It focuses on the structure, content placement, and functionality rather than detailed design or color. Wireframes are typically low-fidelity and use basic shapes and lines to represent different UI elements.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

- **Clarifies Structure:** Helps visualize the layout and how elements will be arranged.
- **Improves Communication:** Provides a clear and easy way for designers, developers, and stakeholders to discuss ideas.
- **Saves Time and Cost:** Identifies potential issues early before detailed design or development starts.
- **Focuses on User Experience:** Allows testing navigation flow and usability without distractions from visual design.
- **Guides Development:** Serves as a blueprint for developers to follow during implementation.

Wireframing is a crucial step to ensure the final product meets user needs and project goals effectively.
